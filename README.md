Getting Started
---

Make sure you have Jekyll and the dependencies installed.

```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle add webrick
```

...you might need to have elevated `sudo` permissions for all three of those, actually.

Serve the site using

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
